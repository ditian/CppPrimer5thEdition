int value = 0;
while (std::cin >> value) { ... }

"std::cin >> value" returns the left operand, which is std::cin.
When we use an istream as a condition, the effect is to test the state of the stream.
If the stream is valid -- that is, if the stream hasn't encountered an error -- then the test succeeds.
An istream becomes invalid when we hit end-of-file, or encounter an invalid input, such as reading a value that is not
an integer.
